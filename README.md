# Assignment 1 – Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains solutions for Questions 1 to 8. Each script handles a specific task as described below.

# File Descriptions

# question1.py
Multiplies consecutive integers (starting from 1) until the product exceeds a given threshold. Prints the final product and the last integer used.
# question2.py
Takes a list of strings and returns a nested dictionary containing the length of each string and whether it is even or odd.
# question3.py

# question4.py
Generates a list of random numbers, sorts them, and identifies the first index where the value is greater than or equal to a target number.
# question5.py
Calculates the area of two circles and determines the percentage of the larger circle covered by the smaller one. Includes input validation for radii.
# question6.py
Analyzes a list of numbers to compute the percentage of values less than or equal to each unique element (cumulative distribution).
# question7.py
Converts total seconds into a standard 12-hour time format (HH:MM:SS AM/PM).
# question8.py
Constructs a Pandas DataFrame and adds a new column with values calculated from existing data.
